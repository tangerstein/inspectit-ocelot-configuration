      # the path to the directory to scan for configuration files
      # scanning happens non-recursive meaning that no subdirectories will be parsed
      path:

      # The frequency at which the target folder should be polled for changes if 'watch' is true.
      # If the frequency is set to zero, a OS notification based approach is used instead of polling.
      # However, depending on the filesystem OS notification might not work, e.g. for network filesystems.
